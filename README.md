# Boom Boom Roulette

## Overview
A roulette style Windows Forms app developed in C#. This app simulates the mechanics of a game of russian roulette but instead it uses a nerf gun. The app does this by "loading" a nerf gun with either "live" or "blank" darts. The user can point the nerf gun at either themselves or someone else. The user then fires the dart and either there will be a "Bang" meaning it was a "live" dart, or there will be a "Click" meaning that it was a "Blank" dart.  

## User Experience
When the user starts the application, they are first presented with a Main Menu that allows them to enter there name, and start the simulation. 

## Features
- Function that generates and array of data that contains whether a round is considered "Live or Not". It this by using a for loop that generates a random number. Then based on the random adds a string to the array. This string can either be "Live" or "Blank".
- The ability to save user data to a file then refrence it later.
